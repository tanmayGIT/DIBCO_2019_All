Our approach first simulate the way the human visual system perceives distant objects by applying the first step of the algorithm proposed in [1]. Afterwards, we apply Howe's binarization method [2]. The reason for combining these two techniques is that Howe's method may fail in some situations in which its parametric choice is optimal for only a part of the image, as in cases of degradation generated by smudges or uneven illumination. As the algorithm presented in [1] showed good results in these situations, we expect that this combination can achieve promising results. We have used DIBCO'11 dataset to tune the parameters (minimum angle of resolution and the radiuses of the structuring elements) of the algorithm in [1] using the I/F-Race [3] approach.
